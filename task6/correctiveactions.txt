1. Enable MFA on the Root Account

Issue: Root account has the highest privileges and is often unsecured.
Fix:

Go to IAM → Dashboard → Activate MFA

Use a virtual MFA device (Google Authenticator / Authy)

Why: Prevents unauthorized access to the entire AWS account.

2. Remove Any Root Access Keys

Issue: Root access keys are extremely risky and should never exist.
Fix:

Go to IAM → Users → Security Credentials

Delete root access keys if they are present.

Why: Root keys can be used to fully compromise the account.

3. Enable CloudTrail

Issue: No logging → No visibility into activity.
Fix:

Go to CloudTrail → Create Trail

Enable:

Multi-region trail

Log file validation

SSE-S3 or KMS encryption

Why: Required for security monitoring and auditing.

4. Enable GuardDuty

Issue: Threat detection disabled.
Fix:

Open GuardDuty → Enable

Leave default protections on

Why: Detects suspicious activity, brute-force attacks, and IAM misuse.

5. Enable AWS Config

Issue: No configuration tracking.
Fix:

Go to AWS Config → Enable

Record all resources

Store logs in S3 (encrypted)

Why: Helps track changes and detect misconfigurations later.

6. Turn On S3 Block Public Access (Global Setting)

Issue: If not enabled, future buckets may become public by accident.
Fix:

Go to S3 → Block Public Access (Account Level)

Turn ON all 4 settings

Why: Prevents accidental public data exposure.

7. Review the Default VPC Security Groups

Issue: Default security groups might be too permissive later.
Fix:

Leave inbound empty

Ensure no “Allow 0.0.0.0/0 inbound” rules exist

Why: Prevents future unsecured deployments.

8. Enable Security Hub

Issue: No centralized security dashboard.
Fix:

Go to Security Hub

Enable AWS Foundational Security Best Practices & CIS Benchmark

Why: Helps detect misconfigurations automatically.

9. Set Up Billing and Security Alerts

Issue: No alerts for unusual spend or suspicious events.
Fix:

Set up CloudWatch billing alarms

Enable AWS Account Security Notifications (SNS or email)

Why: Prevents unnoticed breaches or cost spikes.
